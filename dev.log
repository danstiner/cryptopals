 - Completed challenge 6, brute force now uses most likely value for each byte of the key
 - Should introduce a type for brute force result instead of using 3-tuples everywhere

 - Calculating all possible keys as is being done now is on the order of ```256^keyBytes```, this is impractical. Instead the brute force function will have to only use the most likely value for each byte.
