 - Completed challenge 6, brute force now uses most likely value for each byte of the key
 - Introduced a type for brute force result instead of using 3-tuples everywhere
 - Should be possible to re-write combine function using lenses

 - Calculating all possible keys as is being done now is on the order of ```256^keyBytes```, this is impractical. Instead the brute force function will have to only use the most likely value for each byte.
